# Welcome
This is the first of what I am intending to be many articles in my career and my learning journey. Over time, I plan to document all of these with writing, images, source code, and hopefully videos, as well. I'm not an expert, but I believe in building in the open and learning deeply.

## Background
I've spent all of my career up to this point in QA. My experience is mostly with AR/VR on both the hardware and software side, but most of the testing was manual. I'm looking to push my boundaries and rebuild my foundation in mathematics, programming, and systems. I am pledging to commit at least 1 hour every day going forward to each of these three areas (math, programming, and systems). No matter how far this takes me, it will have been a worthy endeavor.

## Goals
Each project serves a specific purpose. Whether that's to learn how something works, to interact with something I've never worked with before, or just to build something I think would be helpful. For each project, I aim to do the following:
* Define my goal for the project
* Detail problems I ran into along the way
* Reflect on what I learned
* Present any unanswered questions I still have

## Why?
Learning and projects are great, but why blog? The primary benefits I see to blogging my journey are to hold myself accountable, build a record of technical growth, and hopefully teach future-me what the current-me is learning and figuring out. Of course, visibility is always nice.

## What about you?
All that being said, if you're on a similar path, or if you're ahead of me and willing to offer advice, I'd love to connect. If you’re just here to lurk, that’s cool too. Thanks for reading.
