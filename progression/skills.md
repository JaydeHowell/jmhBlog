# Overview
Here is a list of all the skills I've identified in my journey and my level of understanding for each of them.
The purpose of this is to self-assess my current skillset and identify areas to improve (especially as this list grows).
As I come across new skills and field areas, I will add them to list.

### Legend
* **Aware** - I have ecountered this, but I have not applied it directly
* **Familiar** - I've used this in a limited scope and only have a basic working knowledge
* **Competent** - I've applied this in real situations and can use it comfortably
* **Skilled** - I understand nuances and tradeoffs, and I can apply this skill in abstract scenarios
* **Expertise** - This is a core-skill. I can teach or lead others in this.

## Top 3 Skills
I'm at the beginning of my journey. So my current skillset is sparse, especially in regards to mathematics, programming, and systems
(my main three focus areas). However, my background has given me skills in the following:
* Test methodology
* Project management
* AR/VR systems

## Areas of Focus
In the short term (April-June), I would like to focus on the following for each area:
* **Math:** Precalculus (aligned with a pre-college course that's required for BSCS enrollment)
* **Programming:** C programming, Java (for OOP practice), Web APIs
* **Systems:** Microcontrollers, UART Serial Debug Console, Cooperative RTOS-Lite
